# 17)Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a
# transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown
# as following:
# D 100
# W 200
# ยก
# D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# D 300
# D 300
# W 200
# D 100
# Then, the output should be: 500
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be
# assumed to be a console input.
